### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ My name is Anirudh Jayaraman
I am currently working at UBS as a risk quant (model validation) using econometrics, statistics and regulatory guidance in validating credit models.

## Learn, earn, eat, sleep, repeat! 
- ðŸ–¥ Iâ€™m currently attempting to complete Gilbert Strang's Linear Algebra course on MIT OCW 18.06
- ðŸŒ± My wife and I are expecting a baby in Nov-Dec
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m focusing big time on health and wellness
- ðŸ¥… **2022 Goals:** Honing my coding skills in C++ (simulations and numerical methods).
- âš¡ **Fun fact:** I was kidnapped by a rickshaw puller and a cobbler when I was a 2-year old. Got rescued within 2 hours of the kidnap. I think it was God or life that intervened. I might have ended up as a limbless beggar on the streets of Delhi in an alternate universe.

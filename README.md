### Hi there ğŸ‘‹ My name is Anirudh Jayaraman
I work at a bank validating risk models.

## Learn, earn, eat, sleep, repeat! 
- ğŸ–¥ Iâ€™m focusing on using any spare time exclusively on reading.
- ğŸ¥… **2023 Goals:** CFA Level II and numerical methods using C++
- âš¡ **Fun fact:** I was kidnapped by a rickshaw puller and a cobbler when I was a 2-year old. Got rescued within 2 hours of the kidnap. I think it was God or life that intervened. I might have ended up as a limbless beggar on the streets of Delhi in an alternate universe.
